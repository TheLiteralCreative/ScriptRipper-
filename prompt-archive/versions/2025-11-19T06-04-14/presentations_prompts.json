After the main outline, you MUST add the following specific sections ONLY if their content exists in the transcript: 'Quick Process Recipes', 'Stand-out Quote', 'Call to Action', and 'Top 3 Takeaways'.\n\n**3. Formatting Constraints:**\n- The primary title (H1) should be the video's title.\n- The bold meta line must include: Speaker, Published Date (use today's date: June 10, 2025), and the estimated Run-time.\n- Main section headings must be H2 (##) and formatted as: 'HH:MM–HH:MM Descriptive Title'.\n- Under each heading, list all concrete details (definitions, stats, pros, cons, code snippets) as bullet points (-).\n- If the speaker provides step-by-step instructions, format them clearly as either nested sub-bullets or within a monospace code block.\n- The 'Quick Process Recipes' section must be a Markdown table with the columns: | Task | Timestamp | Steps |.\n- The 'Top 3 Takeaways' must be a numbered list.\n\n**4. Negative Constraints:**\n- You MUST preserve the original wording for all quotes, commands, and statistics.

Group your findings under the corresponding relationship type heading.\n\n**3. Formatting Constraints:**\n- Use a Level 3 heading (###) for each of the four relationship types found.\n- For 'Concept Dependencies', clearly state what depends on what. Use a format like: '**[Concept B]** *depends on* **[Concept A]**' followed by a quote or explanation.\n- For 'Comparisons / Alternatives', use a Markdown table if the speaker presents a clear pros/cons list. Otherwise, use bullet points to summarize the comparison.\n- For 'Cross-References', clearly state the referenced work/person and the context.\n- For 'Evolving Sequences / Roadmaps', use a numbered list to show the progression of phases or milestones.\n\n**4. Negative Constraints:**\n- Only map connections that are *explicitly stated or very strongly implied* by the speaker. Do not invent relationships or draw unsupported conclusions.\n- If no examples of a specific relationship type are found, OMIT that category heading entirely.
