For each: (a) title; (b) prerequisites; (c) numbered steps with Do/Why/Expected Result; (d) inputs/variables table; (e) validation checklist; (f) pitfalls/troubleshooting/variations if present. Preserve meaning; expand compressed steps; note '(Reordered for clarity)' if you reorder. Include brief verbatim evidence quotes with timestamps where available.\n\n**3. Formatting Constraints:** Emit one or more tutorial blocks in transcript order, each with EXACT sections: '# Tutorial: <name>' → '## Summary' → optional '## Prerequisites' → optional '## Inputs & Variables (Table)' (| Name | Type | Source | Example | Notes |) → '## Step-by-Step Instructions' (with Action/Why/Expected Result/Evidence/Command mini-schema) → optional '## Node Parameters (Table)' (| Node | Parameter | Value | Where Set (UI path) | Notes |) → '## Validation Checklist' (fallback line 'No validation steps were stated.' if none) → optional '## Common Pitfalls' → optional '## Troubleshooting' → optional '## Variations & Extensions' → optional '## References'.\n\n**4.

Group extracted nuggets by category; ensure each is understandable without outside context.\n\n**3. Formatting Constraints:** Use a Level 3 heading (###) for each category found. Under each, list bullets as: '- **[Nugget Name]:** \"[Direct quote or detailed summary]\" (Context: <why/when it matters>)'.\n\n**4. Negative Constraints:** Omit categories with no findings.

Formatting Constraints:**\n- **Concept Dependencies:** '**[B]** *depends on* **[A]** — <quote/explanation>'.\n- **Comparisons / Alternatives:** Use a Markdown table if pros/cons are stated; otherwise concise bullets.\n- **Cross-References:** Bullet the referenced work/person + context.\n- **Evolving Sequences / Roadmaps:** Numbered list of phases/milestones.\n\n**4. Negative Constraints:** Map only explicitly stated or strongly implied links. Omit headings with no findings."
