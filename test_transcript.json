  "transcript": "John: Good morning everyone, thanks for joining today's product planning meeting. Let's get started. Sarah, can you give us an update on the Q1 roadmap?\n\nSarah: Sure, John. We've finalized the features for Q1. The main priority is the new user dashboard redesign. We're also planning to add two-factor authentication and improve our API rate limiting. The team estimates this will take about 8 weeks to complete.\n\nJohn: That sounds great. Mike, from an engineering perspective, is 8 weeks realistic?\n\nMike: I think it's achievable, but we'll need to prioritize the dashboard work first. The 2FA implementation might take longer than expected since we need to integrate with multiple providers. I'd say 10 weeks is safer.\n\nJohn: Okay, let's plan for 10 weeks then. Sarah, can you update the timeline?\n\nSarah: Will do. I'll send out the revised schedule by end of day.\n\nJohn: Perfect. One more thing - Lisa mentioned we need to discuss the budget for the new analytics tool. Lisa, what's the situation?\n\nLisa: Thanks John. We've been evaluating three options: DataDog, New Relic, and our custom solution. DataDog comes in at $5K per month, New Relic at $3K, and building custom would cost about $50K upfront but save money long-term. My recommendation is DataDog despite the higher cost, because it has the best APM features and our team is already familiar with it.\n\nJohn: That makes sense. Let's go with DataDog then. Mike, can you work with Lisa to get that set up?\n\nMike: Absolutely, I'll reach out to their sales team this week.\n\nJohn: Excellent. Before we wrap up, are there any blockers anyone wants to raise?\n\nSarah: Just one - we're still waiting on legal approval for the new terms of service. That's blocking the account settings redesign.\n\nJohn: I'll follow up with legal today. Let's aim to get that resolved by Friday. Anything else? No? Great, thanks everyone. Let's reconvene next Monday same time.\n\nAll: Thanks John!",
